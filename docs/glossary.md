# Glossary

## A 

### Active UID

A UID slot that is considered active within a specific subnet, allowing the associated hotkey to participate as a subnet validator or subnet miner.

**See also:** [Subnet Miners](./miners/), [Subnet Validators](./validators/)

### Archive Node

A type of public subtensor node that stores the entire blockchain history, allowing for full data access and querying capabilities.

**See also:** [Subtensor Nodes](./subtensor-nodes/), [Managing Subtensor Connections](./sdk/managing-subtensor-connections.md)

### Axon

A module in the Bittensor API that uses the FastAPI library to create and run API servers. Axons receive incoming Synapse objects. Typically, an Axon is the entry point advertised by a subnet miner on the Bittensor blockchain, allowing subnet validators to communicate with the miner.

**See also:** [Subnet Miners](./miners/), [Subnet Validators](./validators/)

## B

### Bicameral Legislature

A two-tier legislative system comprising the Triumvirate and the Senate for proposal approval.

### Bittensor Wallet

A digital wallet that holds the core ownership in the Bittensor network and serves as the user's identity technology underlying all operations.

**See also:** [Wallets](./getting-started/wallets.md), [Working with Keys](./working-with-keys.md)

### Block

A unit of data in the Bittensor blockchain, containing a collection of transactions and a unique identifier (block hash). A single block is processed every 12 seconds in the Bittensor blockchain. 

**See also:** [Subtensor API](./sdk/subtensor-api.md)

## C

### Coldkey

A component of a Bittensor wallet responsible for securely storing funds and performing high-risk operations such as transfers and staking. It is encrypted on the user's device. This is analogous to a private key.

**See also:** [Coldkey-Hotkey Security](./getting-started/coldkey-hotkey-security.md), [Working with Keys](./working-with-keys.md)

**See also:** [Coldkey-Hotkey Security](./getting-started/coldkey-hotkey-security.md), [Working with Keys](./working-with-keys.md)

### Commit Reveal

The commit reveal feature is designed to solve the weight-copying problem by giving would-be weight-copiers access only to stale weights. Copying stale weights should result in validators departing from consensus.

**See also:** [Commit Reveal](./subnets/commit-reveal.md)

Code References and Implementation Details

**Commit Reveal as Anti-Weight-Copying Mechanism:**
- Commit reveal prevents weight copying by introducing a time delay between weight commitment and revelation
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/subnets/weights.rs:41` - `do_commit_weights()` implementation
- Validators commit to weights without revealing them immediately, creating a temporal offset
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/subnets/weights.rs:74` - Weight commit storage in `WeightCommits<T>`
- The mechanism ensures that copied weights are stale by the time they can be used
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/subnets/weights.rs:1075` - `get_reveal_blocks()` timing calculation

**Commit Phase Implementation:**

**Commit Hash Generation:**
- Commit hash is generated from validator data using BlakeTwo256
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/tests/weights.rs:1520` - `let commit_hash: H256 = BlakeTwo256::hash_of(&(hotkey, netuid, uids.clone(), weight_values.clone(), salt.clone(), version_key));`
- Hash includes: hotkey, netuid, uids, weight_values, salt, and version_key
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/subnets/weights.rs:74` - Commit storage with hash and timing information

**Commit Validation:**
- **Enablement Check**: Ensures commit-reveal is enabled for the subnet
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/subnets/weights.rs:52` - `ensure!(Self::get_commit_reveal_weights_enabled(netuid), Error::<T>::CommitRevealDisabled);`

**Key Mathematical Insights:**
1. **Commit Hash = BlakeTwo256(hotkey, netuid, uids, weights, salt, version_key)**: Cryptographic commitment
2. **Reveal Epoch = Commit Epoch + Reveal Period**: Timing calculation
3. **Reveal Block Range = [first_reveal_block, last_reveal_block]**: Valid reveal window
4. **Expiration = Current Epoch > Commit Epoch + Reveal Period + 1**: Automatic cleanup
5. **Temporal Offset = Reveal Period × Tempo**: Anti-copying delay

**Network Security Implications:**
- **Weight Copying Prevention**: Temporal offset makes copied weights stale
- **Consensus Stability**: Prevents rapid weight manipulation
- **Validator Commitment**: Requires validators to commit to their assessments
- **Network Decentralization**: Reduces influence of weight-copying validators
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Network changes make stale weights irrelevant

**Complete Commit Reveal Flow:**
1. **Configuration** → Subnet enables commit reveal and sets reveal period
2. **Commit Phase** → Validator commits hash of weights without revealing them
3. **Temporal Offset** → Network progresses for reveal_period epochs
4. **Reveal Window** → Validator reveals weights within valid time window
5. **Hash Verification** → System verifies revealed data matches commit hash
6. **Weight Application** → Verified weights are applied to consensus
7. **Cleanup** → Expired commits are automatically removed

**Commit Reveal vs Traditional Weight Setting:**
- **Traditional**: Immediate weight setting and consensus participation
- **Commit Reveal**: Delayed weight revelation with temporal offset
- **Security**: Commit reveal prevents weight copying and manipulation
- **Complexity**: Additional timing and hash verification requirements
- **Flexibility**: Configurable per subnet based on security needs

### Consensus

A measure of a subnet validator's agreement with other validators on the network, calculated based on their trust scores. This is a $\kappa$-centered sigmoid of trust, influencing the emission calculation.

**See also:** [Yuma Consensus](./yuma-consensus.md), [Consensus-Based Weights](./subnets/consensus-based-weights.md)

### Consensus Score

A core metric in the Yuma Consensus algorithm that represents the stake-weighted median of weights assigned to each neuron by validators. The consensus score serves as a threshold for weight clipping, determining which weights are considered "in consensus" and which are outliers.

**Core Concept:**
The consensus score is calculated as the stake-weighted median of all weights assigned to a specific neuron by validators. This creates a consensus threshold that filters out outlier weights, ensuring that only weights near the median consensus are used in final rank calculations.

**Mathematical Definition:**
For each neuron $j$, the consensus score $C_j$ is calculated as:
$$C_j = \text{weighted\_median}(\{w_{ij} \mid i \in \text{validators}\}, \{s_i \mid i \in \text{validators}\}, \kappa)$$

Where:
- $w_{ij}$ is the weight assigned by validator $i$ to neuron $j$
- $s_i$ is the stake of validator $i$
- $\kappa$ is the consensus majority ratio (typically 51%)
- $\text{weighted\_median}$ is the stake-weighted median function

**Consensus Score in Yuma Consensus:**

**1. Pre-ranks Calculation:**
- **Formula**: `preranks = matmul(weights, active_stake)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate initial ranks before consensus filtering
- **Source**: [`subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:591`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L591)

**2. Consensus Score Calculation:**
- **Formula**: `consensus = weighted_median_col(active_stake, weights, kappa)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate consensus threshold for each neuron
- **Source**: [`subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:595`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L595)

**3. Weight Clipping:**
- **Formula**: `clipped_weights = col_clip(weights, consensus)`
- **Purpose**: Remove weights below consensus threshold
- **Source**: [`subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:598`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L598)

**4. Final Ranks:**
- **Formula**: `ranks = matmul(clipped_weights, active_stake)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate final ranks using consensus-filtered weights
- **Source**: [`subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:605`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L605)

**5. Trust Calculation:**
- **Formula**: `trust = ranks / preranks`
- **Purpose**: Measure consensus alignment impact
- **Source**: [`subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:608`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L608)

**Weighted Median Implementation:**

**Core Algorithm:**
The weighted median is calculated using a binary search approach with stake-weighted partitioning:

**Source**: [`subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/math.rs:1000-1143`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/math.rs#L1000-L1143)

```rust
pub fn weighted_median_col(
    stake: &[I32F32],
    score: &[Vec<I32F32>],
    majority: I32F32,
) -> Vec<I32F32> {
    // For each column (neuron), calculate stake-weighted median
    for c in 0..columns {
        median[c] = weighted_median(&use_stake, &use_score, minority, zero, stake_sum);
    }
}
```

**Column-wise Processing:**
- **Input**: Weight matrix where rows are validators and columns are neurons
- **Output**: Consensus score vector where each element is the consensus threshold for that neuron
- **Stake Weighting**: Each validator's weight is weighted by their stake in the median calculation

**Consensus Score Properties:**

**Range and Interpretation:**
- **Range**: [0, 1] normalized values
- **High Consensus**: Values close to 1 indicate strong validator agreement
- **Low Consensus**: Values close to 0 indicate weak validator agreement
- **Outlier Detection**: Weights below consensus score are clipped to 0

**Network Security Properties:**
- **Anti-Manipulation**: Consensus filtering prevents weight manipulation by outliers
- **Stake-Weighted**: Higher stake validators have more influence in consensus
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Consensus adapts to changing network conditions
- **Majority Rule**: $\kappa$ parameter controls consensus strictness (typically 51%)

**Consensus Score in Metagraph:**

**Data Structure:**
- **Storage**: Consensus scores stored as u16 vectors in blockchain state
- **Retrieval**: Accessed via `metagraph.C` property in Python SDK
- **Normalization**: Converted from u16 to float using `u16_normalized_float()`

**Source**: [`bittensor/bittensor/core/metagraph.py:360-372`](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor/blob/main/bittensor/core/metagraph.py#L360-L372)

```python
@property
def C(self) -> Tensor:
    """
    Represents the consensus values of neurons in the Bittensor network. 
    Consensus is a measure of how much a neuron's contributions are trusted 
    and agreed upon by the majority of the network.
    """
    return self.consensus
```

**Consensus Score vs Other Metrics:**

**Consensus vs Trust:**
- **Consensus**: Stake-weighted median of weights (consensus threshold)
- **Trust**: Ratio of final rank to pre-rank (consensus alignment impact)
- **Relationship**: Consensus determines weight clipping, Trust measures the impact

- **Consensus**: Threshold for weight filtering
- **Ranks**: Final performance scores after consensus filtering
- **Relationship**: Consensus influences rank calculation through weight clipping

**Consensus vs Validator Trust:**
- **Consensus**: Per-neuron consensus thresholds

**Network Configuration:**

**Kappa Parameter:**
- **Default Value**: 0.51 (51% majority)
- **Purpose**: Controls consensus strictness
- **Effect**: Higher kappa = stricter consensus, more weight clipping
- **Source**: [`subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:594`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L594)

2. **Threshold Function**: Consensus score serves as clipping threshold for outlier weights
3. **Dynamic Nature**: Consensus adapts to changing network conditions and stake distribution
4. **Security Mechanism**: Consensus filtering prevents weight manipulation by outlier validators
5. **Majority Rule**: $\kappa$ parameter ensures majority consensus (typically 51%)

**Network Security Implications:**

- **Stake-Based Influence**: Higher stake validators have more influence in consensus
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Consensus thresholds adapt to changing network conditions
- **Anti-Collusion**: Consensus prevents collusive weight manipulation
- **Network Stability**: Consensus creates stable, predictable weight filtering

- **Network Effect**: Consensus creates feedback loop for network stability

**Python SDK Usage:**

**Accessing Consensus Scores:**
```python
import bittensor as bt

# Initialize metagraph
metagraph = bt.metagraph(netuid=1, network="finney", sync=True)

# Get consensus scores for all neurons
consensus_scores = metagraph.C
print(f"Consensus scores: {consensus_scores}")

# Get consensus score for specific neuron
neuron_consensus = consensus_scores[0]  # First neuron
print(f"Neuron 0 consensus: {neuron_consensus}")
```

**Consensus Analysis:**
```python
# Analyze consensus distribution
avg_consensus = consensus_scores.mean()
max_consensus = consensus_scores.max()
min_consensus = consensus_scores.min()

print(f"Average consensus: {avg_consensus:.4f}")
print(f"Max consensus: {max_consensus:.4f}")
print(f"Min consensus: {min_consensus:.4f}")

# Find neurons with highest consensus
top_consensus_indices = consensus_scores.argsort()[::-1][:10]
print("Top 10 consensus neurons:")
for i, idx in enumerate(top_consensus_indices):
    print(f"  {i+1}. UID {idx}: {consensus_scores[idx]:.4f}")
```

**Error Handling:**
- **Network Issues**: Consensus scores may be unavailable during network issues
- **Sync Requirements**: Metagraph must be synced to get current consensus scores
- **Lite Mode**: Consensus scores available in both lite and full metagraph modes

### Delegate

A subnet validator that receives staked TAO tokens from delegators and performs validation tasks in one or more subnets.

**See also:** [Delegation](./staking-and-delegation/delegation.md), [Managing Stake with btcli](./staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-btcli.md)

### Delegate Stake

The amount of TAO staked by the delegate themselves.

**See also:** [Managing Stake with btcli](./staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-btcli.md), [Managing Stake with SDK](./staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-sdk.md)

### Validator Take %

The percentage of emissions a validator takes, of the portion that depends on delegated stake (not including their emissions in proportion to their own self-stake), before the remainder is extracted back to the stakers.

**See also:** [Emissions](./emissions.md)

Code References and Implementation Details

**Validator Take as Delegation Fee:**
- Validator take represents the fee percentage that validators charge delegators for validation services
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs:992-994` - `pub type Delegates<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::AccountId, u16, ValueQuery, DefaultDelegateTake<T>>;`
- Take is stored as a u16 value representing percentage of u16::MAX (65,535)
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/tests/mock.rs:168` - `pub const InitialDefaultDelegateTake: u16 = 11_796; // 18%`
- Default take is 18% (11,796/65,535), with configurable min/max bounds
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs:382` - `T::InitialDefaultDelegateTake::get()`

**Storage and Configuration:**

**Core Storage Implementation:**
- **Delegates Storage**: Maps hotkey to take value in blockchain state
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs:992-994` - `pub type Delegates<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::AccountId, u16, ValueQuery, DefaultDelegateTake<T>>;`
- **Default Values**: Network-wide configuration for take limits
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs:382` - `DefaultDelegateTake<T>()` - Default 18%
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs:393` - `DefaultMinDelegateTake<T>()` - Minimum 9%
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs:977` - `MaxDelegateTake<T>` - Maximum 18%

**Take Management Functions:**

**Increase Take Implementation:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid take increases to maintain network stability
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/staking/increase_take.rs:55-62` - Rate limit validation
- **Strict Increase**: Take can only be increased, never decreased via this function
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/staking/increase_take.rs:50-52` - `ensure!(take > current_take, Error::<T>::DelegateTakeTooLow);`
- **Max Bound Check**: Take cannot exceed network maximum (18%)
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/staking/increase_take.rs:55-56` - `ensure!(take <= max_take, Error::<T>::DelegateTakeTooHigh);`

**Decrease Take Implementation:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid take decreases
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/staking/decrease_take.rs:45-50` - Rate limit validation
- **Strict Decrease**: Take can only be decreased, never increased via this function
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/staking/decrease_take.rs:48-50` - `ensure!(take < current_take, Error::<T>::DelegateTakeTooLow);`
- **Min Bound Check**: Take cannot fall below network minimum (9%)
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/staking/decrease_take.rs:52-53` - `ensure!(take >= min_take, Error::<T>::DelegateTakeTooLow);`

**Emission Calculation Formula:**

**Return Per 1000 TAO Calculation:**
- **Mathematical Formula**: `return_per_1000 = (emissions_per_day * (1 - take_percentage)) / (total_stake / 1000)`
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/rpc_info/delegate_info.rs:23-40` - `return_per_1000_tao()` implementation
- **Take Percentage Conversion**: `take_percentage = take_value / u16::MAX`
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/rpc_info/delegate_info.rs:28-29` - Take to percentage conversion
- **Delegator Return**: Delegators receive `(1 - take_percentage)` of validator emissions
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/rpc_info/delegate_info.rs:30-35` - Delegator return calculation

**Emission Distribution Logic:**

**Validator vs Delegator Emissions:**
- **Validator Self-Stake**: Validator keeps 100% of emissions from their own stake
  - `developer-docs/docs/staking-and-delegation/delegation.md:73-121` - Emission distribution examples
- **Delegated Stake**: Validator takes percentage from delegated stake emissions
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/rpc_info/delegate_info.rs:113` - Take application to delegated emissions
- **Delegator Proportional**: Delegators receive proportional shares of remaining emissions
  - `developer-docs/docs/staking-and-delegation/delegation.md:73-85` - Proportional distribution formula

**Example Calculation:**
- **Validator with 18% take**: Takes 18% of delegated stake emissions
- **Delegators receive**: 82% of delegated stake emissions
- **Total validator emissions**: 100% of self-stake + 18% of delegated stake
- **Mathematical representation**: `validator_total = self_stake_emissions + (delegated_stake_emissions * 0.18)`

**Rate Limiting and Security:**

**Transaction Rate Limits:**
- **Take Change Rate Limit**: Prevents rapid take manipulation
  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/staking/increase_take.rs:55-62` - Rate limit enforcement

**Complete Validator Take Flow:**
1. **Registration** → Validator registers and sets initial take (18% default)
2. **Delegation** → Delegators stake to validator
3. **Emission Calculation** → Yuma Consensus calculates validator emissions
4. **Take Application** → Validator extracts take percentage from delegated emissions
5. **Distribution** → Remaining emissions distributed to delegators proportionally
6. **Take Management** → Validator can increase/decrease take within bounds
7. **Rate Limiting** → Changes rate-limited to prevent manipulation

**Validator Take vs Other Network Fees:**
- **Validator Take**: Fee for validation services (9-18%)
- **Staking Fee**: One-time fee for delegation (network parameter)
- **Registration Fee**: One-time fee for subnet registration
- **Childkey Take**: Fee for childkey delegation (separate parameter)
- **Network Owner Cut**: Subnet owner's share of emissions

**Economic Implications:**
- **Market Competition**: Validators compete on take rates and performance
- **Delegator Choice**: Delegators choose validators based on take and returns
- **Network Efficiency**: Take incentivizes quality validation services
- **Economic Security**: Take creates skin-in-the-game for validators
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Take can be adjusted based on market conditions

**Python SDK Usage:**

**Setting Validator Take:**
- **Main Method**: `subtensor.set_delegate_take()` - Automatically chooses increase/decrease based on current value
  - `bittensor/bittensor/core/subtensor.py:3283-3366` - `set_delegate_take()` implementation
- **Direct Methods**: `increase_take_extrinsic()` and `decrease_take_extrinsic()` for specific operations

**Basic Usage Example:**
```python
import bittensor as bt

# Initialize subtensor connection
subtensor = bt.subtensor()

# Create wallet (must own the hotkey)
wallet = bt.wallet()

# Set validator take to 15% (0.15)
success, message = subtensor.set_delegate_take(
    wallet=wallet,
    hotkey_ss58=wallet.hotkey.ss58_address,
    take=0.15,  # 15% take
    wait_for_inclusion=True,
    wait_for_finalization=True
)

if success:
    print(f"✅ Take updated successfully: {message}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Failed to update take: {message}")
```

**Getting Current Take:**
```python
# Get current take for a hotkey
current_take = subtensor.get_delegate_take(hotkey_ss58="5F...")
print(f"Current take: {current_take:.2%}")  # e.g., "Current take: 18.00%"
```

**Error Handling:**

  - `bittensor/bittensor/core/errors.py:63-67` - Error definition
- **DelegateTakeTooLow**: Take below minimum (9%) or invalid decrease
  - `bittensor/bittensor/core/errors.py:70-75` - Error definition
- **DelegateTxRateLimitExceeded**: Too frequent take changes
  - `bittensor/bittensor/core/errors.py:165-171` - Rate limit error
- **NonAssociatedColdKey**: Wallet doesn't own the hotkey
- **HotKeyAccountNotExists**: Hotkey not registered

**Advanced Usage:**
```python
# Async usage
async def update_validator_take():
    async with bt.subtensor() as subtensor:
        success, message = await subtensor.set_delegate_take(
            wallet=wallet,
            hotkey_ss58=wallet.hotkey.ss58_address,
            take=0.12,  # 12% take
            raise_error=True  # Raise exceptions instead of returning False
        )
        return success, message

# Direct extrinsic calls (for specific increase/decrease)
from bittensor.core.extrinsics.take import increase_take_extrinsic, decrease_take_extrinsic

# Force increase take
success, message = increase_take_extrinsic(
    subtensor=subtensor,
    wallet=wallet,
    hotkey_ss58=wallet.hotkey.ss58_address,
    take=13107,  # u16 value for ~20% (13107/65535)
    wait_for_inclusion=True
)
```

**Take Value Conversion:**
- **Float to u16**: `take_u16 = int(take_float * 0xFFFF)`
  - `bittensor/bittensor/core/subtensor.py:3330` - Conversion implementation
- **u16 to Float**: `take_float = take_u16 / 0xFFFF`
  - `bittensor/bittensor/core/subtensor.py:1117` - `u16_normalized_float()` usage

### Delegation

Also known as staking, delegating TAO to a validator (who is thereby the delegate), increases the validator's stake and secure a validator permit.

**See also:** [Delegation](./staking-and-delegation/delegation.md), [Managing Stake with btcli](./staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-btcli.md)

### Dendrite  

A client instance used by subnet validators and subnet miners to transmit information to axons on subnet miners and subnet validators. Dendrites communicate with axons using the server-client (Axon-dendrite) protocol.

**See also:** [Subnet Miners](./miners/), [Subnet Validators](./validators/)

### Deregistration

The process of removing a subnet miner or a subnet validator from the subnet due to poor performance.

**See also:** [Miner Deregistration](./miners/#miner-deregistration), [Subnet Miners](./miners/)

## E 

### EdDSA Cryptographic Keypairs

A cryptographic algorithm used to generate public and private key pairs for coldkeys and hotkeys in the Bittensor wallet.

**See also:** [Working with Keys](./working-with-keys.md), [Coldkey-Hotkey Security](./getting-started/coldkey-hotkey-security.md)

### Effective stake

The total staked TAO amount of a delegate, including their own TAO tokens and those delegated by nominators.

**See also:** [Managing Stake with btcli](./staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-btcli.md), [Managing Stake with SDK](./staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-sdk.md)

### Emission

Every block, currency is injected into each subnet in Bittensor, and every tempo (or 360 blocks), it is extracted by participants (miners, validators, stakers, and subnet creators).

Emission is this process of generating and allocating currency to participants. The amount allocated to a given participant over some duration of time is also often referred to as 'their emissions' for the period.

**See also:** [Emissions](./emissions.md)

### Encrypting the Hotkey

An optional security measure for the hotkey.

**See also:** [Coldkey-Hotkey Security](./getting-started/coldkey-hotkey-security.md), [Working with Keys](./working-with-keys.md)

**See also:** [Wallets](./getting-started/wallets.md), [Installation](./getting-started/installation.md)

## H 

### Hotkey

A component of a Bittensor wallet responsible for less secure operations such as signing messages into the network, secure a UID slot in a subnet, running subnet miners and subnet validators in a subnet. It can be encrypted or unencrypted, but is unencrypted by default. The terms "account" and "hotkey" are used synonymously.

**See also:** [Coldkey-Hotkey Security](./getting-started/coldkey-hotkey-security.md), [Working with Keys](./working-with-keys.md)

## I 

### Immunity Period

A grace period granted to a newly registered subnet miner or subnet validator, during which they will not be deregistered due to performance. Allows a miner or validator new to the subnet to adapt and improve their performance, in order to avoid deregistration once the immunity period expires.

**See also:** [Subnet Miners](./miners/), [Subnet Validators](./validators/)

8. **Emission Distribution** → Neurons receive TAO emissions based on performance
9. **Performance Monitoring** → Neuron performance is continuously evaluated
10. **Pruning Risk** → Low-performing neurons risk replacement by new registrations

**Neuron vs Subnet Relationship:**
- **Subnet Container**: Neurons exist within specific subnets identified by netuid
- **Subnet Limits**: Each subnet has maximum allowed UIDs (typically 256)
- **Subnet-Specific**: Neuron metrics and state are subnet-specific

- **Miner = Role**: Neurons without validator permits perform subnet-specific tasks
- **Role Flexibility**: Neurons can change roles based on permit status and stake
- **Performance Metrics**: Both roles contribute to neuron's overall performance score

## R 

### RAO

A denomination of TAO, representing one billionth (10<sup>-9</sup>) of a TAO.

**See also:** [Emissions](./emissions.md)

### Rank

A measure of a subnet miner's performance relative to other subnet miners in the same subnet, calculated based on the subnet miner's trust and incentive scores. This is the sum of weighted stake, contributing to the emission process.

**See also:** [Emissions](./emissions.md), [Yuma Consensus](./yuma-consensus.md)

### Recycling, burning, and locking

"Recycling TAO" means that this TAO is put back into the Bittensor emissions system. Instead of minting new TAO this recycled TAO that is in the recycle bin will be used again in the new emissions.

This happens in two cases:

- When you register either as a subnet validator or a subnet miner and get a `UID` in return, the registration cost TAO you pay is recycled. 
- Emissions are recycled for those subnets that have registration turned off or paused.

When TAO is burned it is permanently removed from circulation, reducing total supply.

Locked TAO is neither recycled nor burned, but held unspent, without the ability to move it until it is unlocked. The cost for subnet registration is locked and returned if the subnet is deregistered.

  - `bittensor/core/chain_data/neuron_info_lite.py:30` - `validator_trust (float): Validator trust value of the neuron.`
- Validator trust is crucial for network security and validation processes

**Trust in Consensus and Emission Calculation:**

**The Staked Weighted Trust System:**
The consensus mechanism in Bittensor operates on a "staked weighted trust system" where trust values are combined with stake weights to determine consensus scores. This system leverages the collective judgment of all participating peers to create a robust consensus mechanism.

**Natural Language Analysis:**
In simple terms, the consensus system works like a weighted voting mechanism where:
1. Each neuron's opinion (weight) about other neurons is weighted by their stake
2. Trust values determine how much influence each neuron has in the consensus
3. Higher trust means more influence in the consensus calculation
4. The $\kappa$-centered sigmoid function transforms trust values into consensus scores

**Code Implementation Details:**

**Consensus Property in Metagraph:**
- Consensus values are stored as tensors in the metagraph and accessed via `metagraph.C`
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:360-372` - Property C() documentation and implementation
- The consensus property returns `self.consensus` which contains consensus scores for all neurons
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:372` - `return self.consensus`

**Consensus Data Flow:**
- Consensus values are read from blockchain state and stored in neuron data structures
  - `bittensor/core/chain_data/neuron_info.py:147` - `consensus=u16_normalized_float(decoded["consensus"]),`
  - `bittensor/core/chain_data/neuron_info_lite.py:113` - `consensus=u16_normalized_float(decoded["consensus"]),`
- Consensus values are normalized using `u16_normalized_float()` function, converting from 16-bit integers to float values between 0 and 1
- In the metagraph, consensus is represented as a tensor accessible via `metagraph.C` property
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:759-762` - `self.consensus = self._create_tensor([neuron.consensus for neuron in self.neurons], dtype=self._dtype_registry["float32"],)`

**Trust → Consensus → Rank → Incentive → Emission Pipeline:**

**Step 1: Trust Calculation from Weights**
- Trust values are "inferred from the network's inter-peer weights"
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:385-386` - `The trust matrix is inferred from the network's inter-peer weights, indicating the level of trust each neuron has in others.`
- Each neuron i sets weights w_ij towards other neurons j, reflecting trust assessments
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:442-443` - `These weights are reflective of the neuron's assessment or judgment of other neurons in the network.`
- Higher weights from neuron i to neuron j imply greater trust or value placed on neuron j's contributions
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:449` - `can imply greater trust or value placed on that neuron's contributions.`

**Step 2: Consensus Calculation via $\kappa$-Centered Sigmoid**
- Trust influences consensus through the $\kappa$-centered sigmoid function
- `bittensor/core/glossary.md:52` - `This is a $\kappa$-centered sigmoid of trust, influencing the emission calculation.`
- The $\kappa$-centered sigmoid transforms trust values into consensus scores, creating a non-linear relationship that amplifies high trust values and dampens low trust values

**Step 3: Rank Calculation from Trust and Incentive**
- Rank is calculated based on the subnet miner's trust and incentive scores
  - `bittensor/core/glossary.md:232` - `calculated based on the subnet miner's trust and incentive scores.`
- Rank values are stored in neuron data structures and normalized
  - `bittensor/core/chain_data/neuron_info.py:154` - `rank=u16_normalized_float(decoded["rank"]),`
  - `bittensor/core/chain_data/neuron_info_lite.py:120` - `rank=u16_normalized_float(decoded["rank"]),`
- Rank determines a neuron's position in the network hierarchy and influences emission distribution

**Step 4: Incentive Calculation**
- Incentive values represent rewards neurons receive for their contributions
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:332-342` - Property I() documentation
- Incentive is based on informational value, stake, and consensus with other peers
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:334-336` - `The Bittensor network employs an incentive mechanism that rewards neurons based on their informational value, stake, and consensus with other peers.`
- Trust values are used in the Yuma Consensus algorithm for computing emissions
- Incentive values are normalized and stored in neuron structures
  - `bittensor/core/chain_data/neuron_info.py:145` - `incentive=u16_normalized_float(decoded["incentive"]),`
  - `bittensor/core/chain_data/neuron_info_lite.py:111` - `incentive=u16_normalized_float(decoded["incentive"]),`

**Step 5: Emission Distribution**
- Emission values denote the distribution of rewards to neurons
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:344-354` - Property E() documentation
- Emissions are based on stake and performance, with trust influencing the distribution
  - `bittensor/core/metagraph.py:348-350` - `Emissions refer to the distribution or release of rewards (often in the form of cryptocurrency) to neurons, typically based on their stake and performance.`
- The emission mechanism ensures active and contributing neurons are appropriately rewarded

**Testing Evidence of the Pipeline:**

**Initial State (New Neurons):**
- Trust starts at 0 for new neurons
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:69` - `assert bob_neuron.trust == 0`
- Consensus, incentive, and rank all start at 0
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:71-73` - `assert bob_neuron.incentive == 0`, `assert bob_neuron.consensus == 0`, `assert bob_neuron.rank == 0`

**After Successful Operation:**
- Miner trust reaches 1.0 (full trust)
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:129` - `assert bob_neuron.trust == 1`
- Consensus, incentive, and rank all increase above 0.5
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:125-127` - `assert bob_neuron.incentive > 0.5`, `assert bob_neuron.consensus > 0.5`, `assert bob_neuron.rank > 0.5`
- Validator trust approaches 1.0 (\>0.99) for properly functioning validators
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:119` - `assert alice_neuron.validator_trust > 0.99`

**Validator vs Miner Dynamics:**
- Validators receive dividends (1.0) and have high validator_trust (\>0.99)
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:116-117` - `assert alice_neuron.dividends == 1.0`, `assert alice_neuron.validator_trust > 0.99`
- Validators have lower incentive, consensus, and rank (\<0.5) compared to miners
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:118,120-121` - `assert alice_neuron.incentive < 0.5`, `assert alice_neuron.consensus < 0.5`, `assert alice_neuron.rank < 0.5`
- Miners have higher incentive, consensus, and rank (\>0.5) and full trust (1.0)
  - `tests/e2e_tests/test_incentive.py:125-127,129` - Various assertions showing miner values

**Mathematical Relationship:**
The relationship between trust, consensus, rank, incentive, and emission can be conceptualized as:
1. **Trust (T)** = f(weights_matrix) - Collective assessment from inter-peer weights
2. **Consensus (C)** = $\kappa$-sigmoid(T, stake_weights) - $\kappa$-centered sigmoid of trust weighted by stake
3. **Rank (R)** = g(T, I) - Function of trust and incentive scores
4. **Incentive (I)** = h(consensus, stake, informational_value) - Based on consensus and other factors
5. **Emission (E)** = i(rank, stake, performance) - Final reward distribution

**Network Security Implications:**
- Trust mechanisms prevent malicious actors from gaining undue influence
- The $\kappa$-centered sigmoid creates a non-linear trust amplification that rewards high-trust neurons
- The staked weighted system ensures that high-stake validators have more influence in consensus
- Trust creates a reputation system that guides network decision-making and emission distribution
- The entire pipeline ensures that reliable contributors are identified and rewarded appropriately

**Complete Trust Flow Implementation:**

**1. Weight Setting and Storage:**
- Validators set weights via `set_weights()` extrinsic
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/subnets/weights.rs:676` - `pub fn do_set_weights()`

  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:595` - `let consensus: Vec<I32F32> = weighted_median_col_sparse(&active_stake, &weights, n, kappa);`
- **Weight clipping**: `clipped_weights = col_clip_sparse(&weights, &consensus)`
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:598` - `let clipped_weights: Vec<Vec<(u16, I32F32)>> = col_clip_sparse(&weights, &consensus);`
- **Post-clip ranks**: `ranks = matmul_sparse(&clipped_weights, &active_stake, n)`
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:605` - `let mut ranks: Vec<I32F32> = matmul_sparse(&clipped_weights, &active_stake, n);`

**4. Trust Formula Implementation:**
- **Trust calculation**: `trust = vecdiv(&ranks, &preranks)`
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:608` - `let trust: Vec<I32F32> = vecdiv(&ranks, &preranks);`
- **vecdiv function**: Element-wise division with zero protection
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/math.rs:322` - `pub fn vecdiv(x: &[I32F32], y: &[I32F32]) -> Vec<I32F32>`
- **Mathematical meaning**: Trust = (rank_after_clipping) / (rank_before_clipping)
  - Range: [0, 1] where 1.0 means no clipping occurred (full consensus)

**5. Storage and Metagraph Reporting:**
- Trust values are converted to u16 for storage
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:850` - `let cloned_trust: Vec<u16> = trust.iter().map(|xi| fixed_proportion_to_u16(*xi)).collect();`
- Trust is stored in blockchain state
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:857` - `Trust::<T>::insert(netuid, cloned_trust);`
- Metagraph retrieves trust from blockchain state

  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/math.rs:374` - `pub fn row_sum_sparse(sparse_matrix: &[Vec<(u16, I32F32)>]) -> Vec<I32F32>`
- **Mathematical meaning**: Validator trust = sum of all clipped weights set by that validator

**7. Trust in Emission Calculation:**
- Trust influences incentive calculation through consensus mechanism
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:610` - `let incentive: Vec<I32F32> = ranks.clone();`
- Trust affects bond formation and validator dividends
  - `pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:631` - `let weights_for_bonds: Vec<Vec<(u16, I32F32)>> = interpolate_sparse(&weights, &clipped_weights, n, bonds_penalty);`
- Trust creates feedback loop: high trust → better consensus → higher rewards → stronger bonds

**Notes:**
1. **Trust = 1.0**: Neuron's weights were not clipped, indicating full consensus agreement
2. **Trust < 1.0**: Neuron's weights were clipped, indicating disagreement with consensus
3. **Trust = 0.0**: Neuron received no consensus weight, indicating complete disagreement
4. **Validator Trust**: Measures how much consensus weight each validator contributes
5. **Dynamic Nature**: Trust updates every epoch based on current weight submissions

**Security Properties:**
- **Anti-manipulation**: $\kappa$-centered clipping prevents weight manipulation
- **Stake-weighted**: Higher stake validators have more influence in consensus
- **Consensus-driven**: Trust rewards alignment with majority opinion
- **Bond formation**: Trust influences long-term validator-miner relationships

2. **Threshold Filtering** → Neurons below minimum stake excluded
3. **Top-K Selection** → Top K neurons by stake awarded permits
4. **Storage Update** → New permits stored in blockchain state
5. **Access Control** → Permits control weight setting and consensus participation
6. **Bond Management** → Permits determine bond retention/clearing
7. **Metagraph Reporting** → Permits included in network state reporting
8. **Delegate VPermits** → Individual permits aggregated into delegate VPermits

**Validator Permit vs VPermit Relationship:**
- **Validator Permit**: Neuron-level boolean flag (has permit or not)
- **VPermit**: Delegate-level list of subnet IDs where delegate has permits
- **Aggregation**: VPermit = list of netuids where delegate's neurons have validator_permit = true
- **Hierarchy**: VPermit aggregates multiple validator permits across subnets for a single delegate
- **Purpose**: Validator permit controls individual neuron access, VPermit controls delegate-level permissions


### Validator

A type of node in a subnet that creates tasks, evaluates the performance of subnet miners and sets weights based on their output. A subnet validator is connected only to subnet miners and to the external world. Subnet validators receive inputs from the external world and communicate bidirectionally with subnet miners. 

**See also:** [Subnet Validators](./validators/), [Validators btcli Guide](./validators/validators-btcli-guide.md)

### Validator-Miner Bonds

A mechanism in the Bittensor network that represents the investment relationship between validators and miners, used to calculate validator emissions and incentivize consistent, honest evaluation of miner performance.

**Core Concept:**
Bonds represent the "investment" a validator has made in evaluating a specific miner. This bonding mechanism is integral to the network's market-based approach to measuring and rewarding machine intelligence through the Yuma Consensus algorithm.

**Bond Formation Process:**

**1. Instant Bond Calculation:**
The instant bond $\Delta B_{ij}$ of validator $i$ to miner $j$ is calculated as:
$$\Delta B_{ij} = \frac{S_i \cdot \widetilde{W_{ij}}}{\sum_{k \in \mathbb{V}} S_k \cdot \widetilde{W_{kj}}}$$

Where:
- $S_i$ is validator $i$'s stake
- $\widetilde{W_{ij}}$ is the bond-weight (penalty-adjusted weight)
- The denominator normalizes by the total bond-weight for miner $j$ across all validators

**2. Bond-Weight Calculation:**
Bond-weights are penalized when validators overstate miner performance:
$$\widetilde{W_{ij}} = (1-\beta)W_{ij} + \beta\overline{W_{ij}}$$

Where:
- $W_{ij}$ is the original weight set by validator $i$ for miner $j$
- $\overline{W_{ij}}$ is the consensus-clipped weight
- $\beta$ is the bonds penalty factor (configurable hyperparameter)

**3. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Bonds:**
Instant bonds are smoothed over time using EMA to prevent abrupt changes:
$$B_{ij}^{(t)} = \alpha \Delta B_{ij} + (1-\alpha)B_{ij}^{(t-1)}$$

Where $\alpha$ is the EMA smoothing factor (typically around 10%).

**Bond Mechanics and Incentives:**

**Consensus Alignment:**
- Validators who stay near consensus build stronger EMA bonds
- Bonds are penalized when validators overstate miner performance
- The EMA smooths out abrupt swings in validator behavior
- Bonds incentivize consistent alignment with consensus

**Validator Emissions:**
Each validator's share of validator emissions (41% of subnet emissions) is calculated as:
$$V_i = \sum_{j \in \mathbb{M}} (B_{ij} \times M_j)$$

Where $M_j$ is miner $j$'s share of miner emissions.

**Bond Management:**

**Bond Retention:**
- Neurons retain bonds only if they keep validator permits
- Bonds are cleared when neurons lose validator permits
- Bonds are stored as sparse matrices in blockchain state

**Bond Decay:**
- Bonds decay over time based on the `bonds_moving_avg` parameter
- Higher decay rates make bonds more responsive to recent performance
- Lower decay rates allow bonds to persist longer

**Network Security Properties:**

**Anti-Manipulation:**
- Bonds prevent weight manipulation through economic penalties
- Validators must "put skin in the game" to influence consensus
- Bond penalties discourage collusive over-evaluation of miners

**Economic Alignment:**
- Bonds create long-term relationships between validators and miners
- Validators are incentivized to discover and support promising miners early
- Bond strength reflects validator confidence in miner performance

**Dynamic Adjustment:**
- Bonds adapt to changing network conditions and consensus
- EMA smoothing prevents exploitation of rapid bond changes
- Bonds provide stability while allowing for network evolution

**Technical Implementation:**

**Storage:**
- Bonds are stored as sparse matrices in blockchain state
- Each validator's bonds to miners are stored as vectors of (miner_uid, bond_value) pairs
- Bonds are updated every epoch during Yuma Consensus execution

**Retrieval:**
- Bonds can be queried via the `bonds()` method in the Subtensor API
- Metagraph includes bonds matrix accessible via `metagraph.B` property
- Bonds are included in neuron information structures

**Hyperparameters:**
- `bonds_penalty`: Controls penalty for out-of-consensus weights (0-65535)
- `bonds_moving_avg`: Controls bond decay rate (typically 900,000)
- `liquid_alpha_enabled`: Enables dynamic alpha adjustment for bonds

**Relationship to Other Network Components:**

**Trust and Consensus:**
- Bonds influence trust calculation through consensus mechanisms
- High bond values indicate strong validator-miner relationships
- Trust creates feedback loop: high trust → better consensus → higher bonds

**Validator Permits:**
- Bonds are retained only by neurons with validator permits
- Loss of validator permit clears all bonds for that neuron
- Bonds align with permit retention for economic security

**Emission Distribution:**
- Bonds directly determine validator emission shares
- Strong bonds lead to higher validator rewards
- Bonds create market-based incentive alignment

**Bond Calculation in Yuma Consensus:**

**1. Bond-Weight Calculation:**

  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:625-627` - Weight interpolation for bonds
- **Mathematical meaning**: $\widetilde{W_{ij}} = (1-\beta)W_{ij} + \beta\overline{W_{ij}}$ where $\beta$ is bonds penalty

**2. Instant Bond Calculation:**

  - `subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs:684` - Bond normalization
- **Mathematical meaning**: $\Delta B_{ij} = \frac{S_i \cdot \widetilde{W_{ij}}}{\sum_{k \in \mathbb{V}} S_k \cdot \widetilde{W_{kj}}}$

**3. EMA Bond Computation:**

  - $B_{ij}$ is the EMA bond from validator $i$ to miner $j$
  - $I_j$ is miner $j$'s incentive share

**Key Mathematical Insights:**
1. **Bonds = Economic Investment**: Bonds represent validator "investment" in miner performance
2. **Penalty Mechanism**: Bonds penalty ($\beta$) reduces bond value for out-of-consensus weights
3. **EMA Smoothing**: Bonds change gradually over time, preventing manipulation
4. **Consensus Alignment**: Bonds incentivize validators to align with network consensus
5. **Economic Security**: Bonds create skin-in-the-game for validators

**Network Security Properties:**
- **Anti-manipulation**: Bond penalties make weight manipulation economically costly
- **Consensus stability**: Bonds create economic incentives for consensus alignment
- **Validator commitment**: Bonds require validators to commit to their evaluations
