# Understanding Neurons


<!-- This needs to be updated and better, and consoloditated with the description in docstring in bittensor, so there isn't redundancy or inconsistency!!!)

The design of Bittensor subnets is inspired by the structure of a simple neural network, with each **neuron** being either a miner or validator. Each neuron is identified by a unique UID within its subnet and associated with a hotkey-coldkey pair for authentication and operations.

## Neuron Architecture Overview

Neurons in a subnet operate within a server-client architecture:

- **Axon (Server)**: Miners deploy Axon servers to receive and process data from validators
- **Dendrite (Client)**: Validators use Dendrite clients to transmit data to miners  
- **Synapse (Data Object)**: Encapsulates and structures data exchanged between neurons

Additionally, the Metagraph serves as a global directory for managing subnet nodes, while the Subtensor connects neurons to the blockchain.

## Neuron Lifecycle and Management

### Registration and UID Assignment

Neurons register with subnets through proof-of-work or burned registration methods, receiving a unique UID (User ID) within their subnet. The registration process follows an append-or-replace algorithm where new neurons either expand the subnet or replace existing low-performing neurons.

### Performance Metrics

Neuron performance is measured through multiple metrics:
- **Rank**: Final performance score after consensus weight clipping
- **Trust**: Consensus alignment ratio measuring impact of consensus filtering  
- **Consensus**: Stake-weighted median of weights serving as clipping threshold
- **Incentive**: Normalized reward allocation for miners
- **Validator Trust**: Specialized trust score for validator neurons

### Validator Permits and Access Control

Top K neurons by stake weight receive validator permits, allowing them to:
- Set weights and participate in consensus
- Form bonds to miners based on performance assessment
- Contribute to active stake calculations

Only permitted neurons can set non-self weights, though all neurons can set self-weights regardless of permit status.

## Neuron-to-neuron communication

Neurons exchange information by:

- Encapsulating the information in a Synapse object.
- Instantiating the server (Axon) and client (dendrite) network elements and exchanging Synapse objects using this server-client (Axon-dendrite) protocol. See the below diagram.

### Axon

The `axon` module in the Bittensor API uses the FastAPI library to create and run API servers. For example, when a subnet miner calls,

```python
axon = bt.axon(wallet=self.wallet, config=self.config)
```

then an API server with the name `axon` is created on the subnet miner node. This `axon` API server receives incoming Synapse objects from subnet validators, i.e., the `axon` starts to serve on behalf of the subnet miner.

Similarly, in your subnet miner code you must use the `axon` API to create an API server to receive incoming Synapse objects from the subnet validators.

### Dendrite

Axon is a **server** instance. Hence, a subnet validator will instantiate a `dendrite` **client** on itself to transmit information to axons that are on the subnet miners. For example, when a subnet validator runs the following code fragment:

```python
    responses: List[bt.Synapse] = await self.dendrite(
        axons=axons,
        synapse=synapse,
        timeout=timeout,
    )
```

then the subnet validator:

- Instantiates a `dendrite` client on itself.
- Transmits `synapse` objects to a set of `axons` (that are attached to subnet miners).
- Waits until `timeout` expires.

### Synapse

A synapse is a data object. Subnet validators and subnet miners use Synapse data objects as the main vehicle to exchange information. The `Synapse` class inherits from the `BaseModel` of the Pydantic data validation library.

For example, in the [Text Prompting Subnet](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/prompting/blob/414abbb72835c46ccc5c652e1b1420c0c2be5c03/prompting/protocol.py#L27), the subnet validator creates a `Synapse` object, called `PromptingSynapse`, with three fieldsâ€”`roles`, `messages`, and `completion`. The fields `roles` and `messages` are set by the subnet validator during the initialization of this Prompting data object, and they cannot be changed after that. A third field, `completion`, is mutable. When a subnet miner receives this Prompting object from the subnet validator, the subnet miner updates this `completion` field. The subnet validator then reads this updated `completion` field.

## The Neuron Metagraph

A metagraph is a data structure that contains comprehensive information about current state of the subnet. When you inspect the metagraph of a subnet, you will find detailed information on all the nodes (neurons) in the subnet. A subnet validator should first sync with a subnet's metagraph to know all the subnet miners that are in the subnet. The metagraph can be inspected without participating in a subnet.

- Key performance metrics stored as normalized float values (0-1 range): rank, emission, incentive, consensus, trust, validator_trust
- Stake information includes both total stake and per-coldkey breakdown
- Network participation data: netuid, validator_permit, weights, bonds

**NeuronInfoLite - Lightweight Neuron Data:**
- Provides essential neuron data without weights and bonds for efficiency
- Used when full weight/bond data is not required, reducing data transfer overhead

### Key Mathematical Insights

1. **Neuron = UID + Hotkey + Coldkey**: Each neuron is uniquely identified by its UID and key pair
2. **Registration = Append or Replace**: New neurons either expand the subnet or replace existing ones
3. **Pruning = Lowest Score**: Neurons with lowest pruning scores are replaced when subnet is full
4. **Immunity = Protection Period**: New neurons are protected from pruning for a configurable period
5. **Performance = Multi-Metric**: Neuron performance is measured by rank, trust, consensus, and incentive

### Network Security Properties

- **Economic Barriers**: Registration costs prevent Sybil attacks
- **Performance-Based Pruning**: Low-performing neurons are automatically replaced
- **Stake-Based Permits**: Validator permits require economic stake for consensus participation
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Neuron state adapts to changing network conditions
- **Owner Protection**: Subnet owners are protected from pruning to ensure network stability

### Neuron Relationships

**Neuron vs Subnet Relationship:**
- **Subnet Container**: Neurons exist within specific subnets identified by netuid
- **Subnet Limits**: Each subnet has maximum allowed UIDs (typically 256)
- **Subnet-Specific**: Neuron metrics and state are subnet-specific
- **Cross-Subnet**: Neurons can participate in multiple subnets with different UIDs
- **Subnet Governance**: Subnet owners have special privileges and protection

**Neuron vs Validator/Miner Roles:**
- **Neuron = Container**: Neuron is the container entity that can be either validator or miner
- **Validator = Role**: Neurons with validator permits can set weights and participate in consensus
- **Miner = Role**: Neurons without validator permits perform subnet-specific tasks
- **Role Flexibility**: Neurons can change roles based on permit status and stake
- **Performance Metrics**: Both roles contribute to neuron's overall performance score
