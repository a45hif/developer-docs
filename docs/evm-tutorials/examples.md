# Bittensor EVM: Examples and Precompiles

## Available Precompiles

The following precompiled smart contracts are available on the Bittensor EVM.
The source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/precompiles).

Code examples used throughout this section are provided by the _Opentensor Foundation_ (_OTF_), and come from [this repository](https://github.com/opentensor/evm-bittensor/tree/main/examples).

## Examples

- [Convert Ethereum (H160) Address to Substrate (SS58)](./convert-h160-to-ss58): Learn how to convert between H160 and SS58 address formats

## Standard Ethereum Precompiles

- `ECRecover` (0x1): Recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature
- `Sha256` (0x2): SHA-256 hash function
- `Ripemd160` (0x3): RIPEMD-160 hash function
- `Identity` (0x4): Identity function (returns input data)
- `Modexp` (0x5): Modular exponentiation
- `Sha3FIPS256` (0x400): SHA3-256 hash function (FIPS variant)
- `ECRecoverPublicKey` (0x401): Recover the public key from an elliptic curve signature
